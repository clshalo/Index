<h1>Most anticipating games of 2021</h1>
<h5>Note:Bootstrap at bottom of page, couldn't decide whether to delete the original or not.</h5>
<p>These are in no particular order.</p>
<h1>Call of Duty: Vanguard</h1>
<p> Barely anything has been shown about the newest cod game coming out this year.
However, it has been confirmed it will be set in WW2.
Not sure why they want to keep going backwards, maybe they really 
have run out of ideas.</p>
<p>There was an event in warzone at 1:30ET 
on Thursday, after all the players destroyed an armored train, they were bombarded 
by thousands of planes. After the player was bombed, the trailer played. It showed 
which allies and axis are in the game, and while the game does look good, they barely 
showed any gameplay.</p>
<p> Most fans in the comments of the teaser trailer of 
the game earlier this week were making fun of the next cod game. Mainly poking fun that call of 
duty is going back to WW2 again and that there will be unrealistic gun camos for the guns. </p>

<h1>Battlefield:2042</h1>
<p>Unlike COD 2021, Battlefield is actually trying to 
be a good game. Their new game tries to be fun instead of being serious. 
Just like in Battlefield:4, you can launch cars, attach c4 to vehicles, 
and jump out of a jet to blow up the jet following you. They are even 
having their own custom servers where any game mode can be made. From 
1 tank vs 20 rc's to a knife fight against 128 players. Supposedly the 
servers will allow mods aswell. It finally seems that Battlefield is finally 
doing what all games should be,  they should be fun.</p>

<h1>Halo:Infinite</h1>
<p>It finally happened. 343 Industies has finally made a 
good Halo game. No more bad campaigns, no more lootboxes, and no more 
ugly armor. While most of the game has not been shown, it seems like it 
is finally going to be a good game again. They recently had their first 
tech preview of the game, where players can play thegae against bots. On 
the last day of the preview, they turned on PvP for 2 hours, and it ran 
perfectly. The only thing to worry about now is the campaign and trying 
to avoid leaks about the game.</p>

      <p>It finally happened. 343 Industies has finally made a 
        good Halo game. No more bad campaigns (hopefully) , no more lootboxes, and no more 
        ugly armor.</p> 
        <p>While most of the game has not been shown, it seems like it 
        is finally going to be a good game again. They recently had their first

        <p>The only thing to worry about now is the campaign and trying 
        to avoid leaks about the game.</p>
        <p>Update: They have unfotunalty delayed the
        co-op and forge modes and will release them after the initial release of the game.
        Co-op will release with season 2 and Forge will release with season 3. So three 
        months after release there will be co-op and six months after release forge will be released.
        Thankfully, they have announced the game will release on December 8th, 2021

        (Not sure why they want to keep going backwards, maybe they really

        <p>There was an event in warzone where players had to destroy a train.
         After all the players destroyed an armored train, they were bombarded 
        by thousands of german planes. After the player was bombed, the trailer played. It showed 
        which allies and axis are in the game, and while the game does look good, they barely 
        showed any gameplay.</p>

        duty is going back to WW2 again and that there will be unrealistic gun camos for the guns. </p>
        <p>There was recently a beta for the game. It looks fun but i have a feeling SBMM will be in it and ruin it.
        hackers can also copy and paste their hacks into vanguard from warzone since there is no anti-cheat.</p>

      <h3>Battlefield 2042</h3>
      <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2042"accesskey="b">Battlefield 2042 wiki</a></h4>
      <img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/ec/Battlefield_2042_cover_art.jpg/220px-Battlefield_2042_cover_art.jpg alt="Battlefield:2042">

        <p>It finally seems that Battlefield is finally 
        doing what all games should be, they should be fun. Unfotunatly, it will be 
        only multiplayer, there is no campaign, and the next gen version of the game 
        is 70 dollars.</p>
        <p> Anyone who has the next gen version of the game will not be 
        able to play with anyone who is playing on last gen. So if someone has a series x, 
        but their friends are playing on a xbox one s, they will nt be able to play 
        unless the series x player buys the last gen version of the game, but that 
        kinda defeats the purpose of having a next gen console.
      </p>
      <p>BREAKING NEWS: It appears Battlefield 2042 has been delayed for a month. 
      It is now set to release November 19, 2021. It is now between COD and Halo, 
      and it's released the same month as Call of Duty. Dice has said that the pandemic 
      has created a lot of challenges in the workplace and they want this game to be 
      perfect with no game breaking bugs.</p>
      <p>Mini rant: 70 dollars for games shouldn't exist, it's hard enough to get a next gen
        console, but buying the next gen version of a game for 70 dollars is stupid. Hopefully
        battlefield will come to Game Pass</p>
